### A company that has established processes throughout the whole project lifecycle is very important for it to succeed.

#### An average customer journey:

#### #1 Consulting

Every great project starts with small consulting sessions in which big problems are divided into small milestones, achievable in a few weeks. In this step, we engage with the customer to put a plan for us to follow through the whole journey.

#### #2 Design

Before digging into the web development itself we need to have the big picture not only in our head but see it in the prototype. Here we design screens to mimic the actual end result of the project.

#### #3 Development Iterations

Our work here revolves around finishing every sprint that consists of functionalities and on each step receiving feedback from the client. This allows us to fix potential issues on the get-go.

#### #4 Project completion and maintenance

This step ensures the final product has the needed attention and the production journey begins. We transition to this project phase if the client needs more functionalities on demand or in most case scenarios we scale the project further.

#### We are very flexible to change our processes depending on the situation and ensure client success.
